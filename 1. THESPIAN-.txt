1. THESPIAN-
   THE THESPIAN CIRCLE: THEATRE HUB OF JIIT

Stars have airs, actors have egos And artistes....they are God’s own instruments to create & spread beauty & art.

The Thespian Circle was born out of labour, many hours of sweat and mostly from the love of art. Passion is the key if there is no passion the stage must be abandoned. To keep your fire burning and to introduce to you a few things we can do to make all our events a success here are some very basic Do’s and Don’ts.
